# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Stackr project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short noun phrase
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
- **Decision**: What are we doing about it?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder as a result?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options did we evaluate?

## Index

- [ADR-0001](0001-remote-stack-deployments.md) - Remote Stack Deployments from Git Repositories

## Creating a new ADR

1. Copy the template or previous ADR
2. Number it sequentially (0002, 0003, etc.)
3. Status starts as "Proposed"
4. Update to "Accepted" once implemented
5. Add to index above
